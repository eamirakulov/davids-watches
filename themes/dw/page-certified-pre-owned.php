			<h3>WHY OUR CERTIFIED PRE-OWNED ROLEX WATCHES ARE DIFFERENT</h3>
			<p>Everyone knows what a new Rolex watch is and where they can buy one; however when it comes to used watches, not all "certified" pre-owned Rolex are considered equal. There are simply too many fake watches and unscrupulous sellers out there to risk taking a chance buying your next watch from an unknown or unverified source.</p>

			<p>"Certified Pre-Owned" is almost certainly a term that you have come across before while looking at buying used Rolex watches, but not all companies follow the same definition of that term.</p>
			<h3>WHAT IS A REAL "CERTIFIED PRE-OWNED" ROLEX?</h3>
			<p>Many companies call their used Rolex watches "certified pre-owned" timepieces; however in most instances, these are not actually "certified" watches. A real Certified Pre-Owned Rolex watch is a timepiece that has been formally evaluated by an independent third-party authority, and issued a certification that attests to the quality and authenticity of the specific watch. A real Certified Pre-Owned Rolex has been inspected and guaranteed to be 100% authentic by two different - entirely independent - companies, not just the one selling the watch.</p>

			<h3>HERE IS WHY OUR CERTIFIED PRE-OWNED ROLEX WATCHES ARE BETTER</h3>

			<p>A Certified Pre-Owned Rolex from David's Watches comes with more than just the thrill of owning the most iconic luxury timepiece in the world. It comes with the certainty of knowing that every single component on your watch is 100% authentic. In addition to our own guarantee (which means a whole lot), your watch can also be certified by an independent authority that objectively evaluates the timepiece and certifies that it is 100% genuine Rolex. This gives you the peace-of-mind that the watch you are buying is exactly the one that you intended to purchase, and that you didn't sacrifice quality or authenticity for a good price.</p>

			<h3>IS YOUR WATCH A REAL CERTIFIED PRE-OWNED ROLEX?</h3>

			<p>Many web-based luxury watch dealers offer "certified pre-owned" Rolex watches; however in most cases, the sellers are the same people certifying them. These are not actually "certified" watches. In order for a watch to legally be considered "certified" the selling party cannot be the same ones who issue the certification. That is why - unlike other sellers - all of our watches come with an optional (and fully independent), third-party certification report issued by WatchCSA, the leading authority on watch certification.</p>

			<p>In order to be issued a certification, every watch must go through a comprehensive process that includes rigorous criteria and meticulously performed procedures. All Certified Pre-Owned Rolex watches will be thoroughly examined by WatchCSA's team of experts, and every component of the watch - inside and out - will be checked for both authenticity and condition. Additionally, all certified watches will have their serial numbers run though both counterfeit and stolen watch database searches to guarantee the integrity and authenticity of every single timepiece.</p>
			<h3>BUY 100% AUTHENTIC WATCHES WITH COMPLETE CONFIDENCE</h3>
			<p>When buying a Rolex, it is important for you to trust the seller - however it is equally important for the seller to be able to prove to you the authenticity and quality of the timepiece that you intend to purchase. Our Certified Pre-Owned watches allow you to buy a Rolex with complete confidence, since the specific watch - and the seller from which you are buying it, have both been verified by an entirely independent, third-party entity.</p>

			<p>As a buyer, it is important for you to be able to know - beyond a doubt - that the watch you are about to purchase meets the remarkably high standards for which Rolex is known. When we offer "certified pre-owned" watches, an unbiased and fully-independent entity is performing the evaluation, so you are not just taking our word that the watch you are buying is 100% authentic, the world's leading authority on watch certification is also standing behind your purchase.</p>
