					David's Buyer's Protection Plan
				</h2>
				<h3>THE DAVID'S BUYER'S PROTECTION PLAN</h3>
				<p>David's Watches is committed to your complete satisfaction and enjoyment of your watch purchase. We offer a hassle-free, 7-day return policy. If, for any reason, you wish to return or exchange your watch, we will do our best to accommodate your request quickly and easily.</p>

				<p>For any unworn, undamaged product with the non-removable David's Watches tag still attached, David's will exchange the watch or offer a full refund based upon the original payment method. Please return all items in the same condition, with the same accessories, and back to the original point of sale through which the watch was sold.</p>

				<p>Refunds will be processed after inspection by our watch experts. Please allow 10 business days for the refund to be reflected on your original payment method. If you paid for your watch via trade-in, or wish to exchange the watch, David's will provide store credit.</p>

				<p>Please note that we are unable to accept returns for any items that have been personalized or engraved, damaged, or worn. If items that were sold with the watch are missing or the watch is worn or damaged, we may charge a restocking fee or reject the item</p>
				<h3>HOW TO MAKE A CLAIM:</h3>
				<p>Please call Customer Care at (800) 494-3708.</p>

				<p>We will discuss our authenticity guarantee and issue a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number for your return. The item must be returned within 30 days from the date we issue the RMA.</p>

				<p>Once you receive an RMA number from Bob's, you must follow the steps below in order to receive credit for the return:</p>

				<p>• Send the item back: Re-pack your watch in its original packaging and shipping box. <br>
					• Follow all emailed instructions on how to send your package back to us</p>

				<h3>RESOLUTION</h3>
				<p>We will proceed to take the necessary steps to re-authenticate the Rolex or any items in question.</p>

				<p>If a watch is deemed to not be authentic, we will promptly refund 100% of the full purchase price. If a watch part is found to not be authentic, we reserve the right to replace that part to restore the watch to 100% authentic condition</p>

					US Shipping Information
				</h2>
				<p>Every watch on our site is in stock and generally ships out within one (1) business day of receipt of your order and verification ( settlement ) from our bank/ credit card company. All domestic orders are shipped FedEx overnight and are fully insured at no charge to the customer.</p>
				<h3>PAYMENT BY CREDIT CARD</h3>
				<p>Orders paid by credit card will be shipped only after the credit card company has approved and "settled" the order. This is normally done each day at 6pm PST on the day of the order if placed before 2pm PST - so your order will ship out the very next business day. Orders placed after 2pm PST will generally ship out the 2nd business day. Please note that all orders must be shipped to the address on file with your credit card company. If you would like your order shipped to an address that is different, other than the one on record with the issuing bank, we ask that you contact your credit card company by calling the phone number on the back of your credit card, and request to place an "alternate shipping address" on record, so that we can verify this information. By stating that you want an "alternate shipping address" it will simply be a notation on your record and should not cause any change in your billing information. It is another fraud-prevention method that we use to be certain that we are dealing with the actual cardholder.</p>

				<p>Estimated delivery dates are based upon orders received by 2pm PST, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. If your order is placed and approved before 2pm PST Monday through Friday, it will generally ship on the next business day. Orders placed after 2pm PST on Friday generally ship on Tuesday. No orders are shipped or delivered on weekends or holidays. We cannot guarantee any particular delivery date. Items ordered together may ship separately.</p>
				<h3>SALES AND USE TAX NOTICE</h3>

				<p>Recently many states have issued guidance regarding purchases for which residents did not pay sales tax. When sales tax is not charged, use tax may be due on transaction that may have otherwise been taxable. It follows the same rules and requirements as sales tax.</p>

				<p>There are three common instances where a use tax obligation may occur:</p>

				<p>* Ordering from a mail‐order catalog <br>
					* Buying over the internet <br>
					* Buying goods in another state but having the merchant ship the goods to you in your resident state as opposed to you taking possession of them in the store.</p>

				<p>In all of these circumstances, if sales tax is not charged and the goods are shipped to you in your resident state, you may owe use tax to your resident state. Use tax is not owed if you pay another state's sales tax on the purchase.</p>

				<p>Remember though that not all internet and mail‐order catalog purchases are subject to use tax. Please refer to your local city, county, or state taxing agency for questions on whether use tax may be applicable to your purchase.</p>

				The above "Sales and Use Tax Notice" is intended for general guidance and informational purposes only. This information is provided with the understanding that it does not render legal, accounting, tax, or other professional advice and services, nor does it promote, market or recommend to another party any transaction or matter addressed herein. The above should not be used as a substitute for consultation with professional advisers and cannot be relied upon by any taxpayer for the purpose of avoiding penalties imposed under the Internal Revenue Code. Before making any decision or taking any action, you should obtain appropriate professional guidance.
