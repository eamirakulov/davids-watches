					How To Sell A Rolex?

				</div>
				<h4>WHERE CAN I SELL ROLEX WATCHES NEAR ME OR ONLINE?</h4>
				<p>Whether at a location near you or online, there are several ways that you can sell Rolex watches. But some are better than others. Pawn shops and jewelry stores near you will always offer you very low prices for your Rolex watch. This is because of their high overheads and lack of knowledge needed to properly value Rolex watches. Online can offer you better prices, but you must be weary of the website you choose. Craigslist can certainly be dangerous since you have to meet up with a complete stranger with an expensive timepiece in hand. eBay unfortunately doesn't do enough to protect the sellers and almost always takes the side of the buyer when conflicts arise. This means you could end up with a returned (and damaged) Rolex without any reimbursement whatsoever.</p>

				<p>David's Watches, on the other hand, is an online marketplace dedicated to buying and selling Rolex watches. As the premier online destination for pre-owned Rolex watches, we boast a team of Rolex trained watchmakers and Rolex specialists to ensure a smooth process when buying from or selling to Bob's Watches.</p>

				<h4>WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO SELL YOUR ROLEX?</h4>
				<p>There are many reasons as to why someone may choose to sell their Rolex. Maybe you currently sport a Submariner 16610 on your wrist and you're ready to upgrade to a 6-digit Cerachrom model. Or maybe you've finally spotted your grail watch and need to make room in your collection. Whatever the reason, pre-owned Rolex watches are in high demand, making it easier than ever before to sell your Rolex. Rolex watches are also popular milestone gifts and are highly sought after purchases for graduations, work anniversaries, and retirements. Rolex timepieces are popular year-round, however, selling your Rolex during a time of year when the demand is high, such as Christmas or graduation season, ensures that you will receive the best possible price.</p>

				<h4>WHAT IS REQUIRED FROM ME TO SELL MY ROLEX?</h4>
				<p>The more information that you are able to provide when selling your Rolex timepiece, the better. A good place to start is by <a href="#">locating your watch's serial and model numbers</a>. This provides the buyer with important information needed to price your watch. Any other documents that you are able to provide, such as sales receipts, warranty papers, and service records are also incredibly helpful as they provide a history of the watch and can help verify its authenticity. The original box and papers can be very valuable in their own right. They let the buyer know that your timepiece is genuine and increase the price that you may receive for your watch. It's becoming increasingly common for buyers to require the original box and papers upon selling your used Rolex, so be sure to keep them in a safe place upon purchasing any Rolex timepieces. Providing these items when selling your Rolex ensures you will receive the highest asking price. Finally, any original parts that you have, such as spare bracelet links, can prove to be very valuable to potential Rolex buyers. Providing as many of the original parts as possible increases your odds of a highly successful sale.</p>
