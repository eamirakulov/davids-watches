			<p>Rolex is widely regarded as one of the most important watch companies in history. The sheer number of Rolex watches sold each year is a testament to their quality. A Rolex is more than a watch – it is a status symbol. For many, owning a Rolex watch brings pure joy; and that joy, in turn, creates a huge demand for these luxury timepieces. Read all the information below from our Rolex expert who has more than 30 years of experience.</p>
			<p>Rolex timepieces are one of the most coveted luxury items in the world. So, consequently, there is a huge market for replica (fake) watches. Most of these fraudulent watches are made in China but research shows that production is spreading throughout all of Asia and other regions too. These forged timepieces typically sell for $25 to $200, and the quality has gotten increasingly better over the past years. The <a href="#">modern Rolex Datejust collection</a> and Rolex Submariner are prime targets for these replicas.</p>
			<p>Even experienced dealers can get fooled by bogus watches. Some knock-offs are easy to spot right away, while other, more sophisticated, counterfeit Rolex watches may be much more challenging to identify. With that said, it can be difficult for a novice to know how to tell if a Rolex is fake. To help protect yourself from dishonest sellers and imitation merchandise, we have compiled a list of the hallmarks of a genuine timepiece. Read carefully to ensure that you are not fooled by counterfeit watches.</p>
			<h3>BEWARE OF EBAY & CRAIGLIST REPRODUCTIONS</h3>
			<p>On the other hand, websites such as Ebay and Craigslist are well-known, but they are only platforms that bring buyers and sellers together, and thus are not accountable for what is being sold. Such sites are often plagued with fraudulent goods, and it's difficult to find trusted and honest Rolex vendors. It could be a dangerous place if you don't already know how to identify a fake Rolex. For that reason, we never recommend eBay or Craigslist.</p>
			<h3>ROLEX ONLY PRODUCES QUALITY TIMEPIECES</h3>

			<p>Rolex is one of the most coveted luxury brands on the planet, and is known for quality, durability, style, and prestige. The company uses the best steel on earth called "Oystersteel" (904L stainless steel), which is more rust and corrosion resistant. Rolex also creates its own precious metal alloys to ensure the exact integrity of every watch. Everything is crafted to absolute perfection, so take a closer look at the case, crown, hands, bezel, bracelet, and clasp – if anything comes across as sub-par quality, then you can be pretty sure it's not the real deal.</p>

				Top 10 Ways To Spot A Fake Rolex
			</h2>
			<h3>1. Serial & Model Number Stamping</h3>
			<img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/sources/comp1.jpg" alt="">
			<p>The serial and model numbers on a genuine Rolex are deep and perfectly marked in solid, very fine lines that will shine in the light at an angle like a diamond cut edge. Conversely, the numbers on many fake, or replica watches, are typically made up of faint tiny dots due to a lower quality marking process . In other cases, these numbers on counterfeit watches will have a sandy-like appearance from being "acid etched" as shown in the photo above on the left.</p>

			<h3>2. Stampings</h3>
			<img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/sources/comp2.jpg" alt="">
			<p>Replica watches come in different grades, and the really low-quality phony ones don't even bother to put the Rolex name or famous crown logo on the watch. This, of course, is a dead giveaway that you are dealing with an inauthentic piece.</p>

			<h3>3. Movement</h3>
			<img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/sources/comp3.jpg" alt="">
			<p>The movement that powers a Rolex is an exercise in master watchmaking skill. A replica watch cannot match the craftsmanship, dedication, precision, and knowledge of a true Rolex caliber. Each genuine movement will always have "Rolex" engraved on it, and of the individual parts will be immaculately finished (as you would expect) which you can only see if you open up the watch.</p>

			<p>Something else to consider is that the majority of Rolex's watches have mechanical movements, so if you're looking at a quartz, that could be a red flag since only a very limited quantity of quartz watches throughout their history have been produced.</p>

			<p>Additionally, with the use of modern technologies such as optical scanning and 3D printing, counterfeiters are getting increasingly better at copying Rolex's designs, with some of the most convincing fakes even going so far as to "clone" the movement of a genuine Rolex. These watches (often called "super fakes") will have a movement that mimics the design and appearance of a genuine Rolex movement; however under closer examination and magnification, the cloned movement will lack the ultra-fine precision finishing of the genuine movement (along with its reliability and precision).</p>

			<h3>4. Dial</h3>
			<p>When it is first manufactured, the dial of an original is more-or-less perfect, so if you see any uneven fonts, inconsistent spaces between the lettering, smudges, and/or misspellings on the watch then then that is a big red flag, and definitely a sign to start looking further into its authenticity.</p>
			<img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/sources/comp4.jpg" alt="">

			<h3>5. Cyclops</h3>

			<img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/sources/comp5.jpg" alt="">
			<p>The Cyclops, in Rolex parlance, is the magnifying lens (on the crystal) above the date window on the face of their watches. On a genuine timepiece, the Cyclops is convex and magnifies the date 2.5 times for increased readability. If, on the watch you're considering, the magnification lens is flat and the date isn't magnified as such, then you are likely dealing with a forgery. To spot counterfeit watches you need to pay close attention to every detail.</p>

			<h3>6. Water Resistance</h3>
			<img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/sources/comp6.png" alt="">
			<p>Rolex wristwatches are built to be waterproof, while forged versions will not withstand a proper water pressure test. However, we strongly discourage using a water test if you doubt that the piece is real, since it will likely ruin the watch, preventing you from being able to return it. Additionally, if a watch is old and in need of repairs or service, there is a good chance it may not pass a water pressure test – even if it is genuine, so it is best to not try to do this yourself. If you believe you have a non genuine timepiece, have it inspected by a reputable professional.</p>

			<h3>7. Weight</h3>
			<img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/sources/comp7.jpg" alt="">
			<p>A genuine Rolex will have some weight to it because they are exclusively manufactured from the finest materials with no corners cut in their production process. A counterfeit watch will feel lighter and flimsy due to a cheaper construction and lesser materials. If your watch doesn't have any heft to it you are likely dealing with a counterfeit.</p>

			<h3>8. Clear Caseback</h3>
			<img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/sources/comp7.jpg" alt="">
			<p>With the exception of a couple of very rare vintage models produced in the 1930s, Rolex does not equip their watches with clear casebacks, so beware of replica watches that have a clear window with a view of the movement on the back of the watch's case.</p>

			<h3>9. Caseback Engravings</h3>
			<img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/sources/comp8.jpg" alt="">
			<p>Except for just a few rare instances, like the Rolex Sea Dweller, Milgauss, COMEX, Military watches, and some older rare models, Rolex does not engrave the exterior of their casebacks with words, logos, or pictures (a majority of the time). If the watch you're looking at features engravings on the back of the watch's case – and they are not the personal engravings from the previous owner, then chances are you have a fake Rolex or imitation replica watch. However, it should be noted that some authentic older lady Rolex Datejust models like the 6917, 69173 and 69174 do have "Stainless Steel" and "Registered Design" on their casebacks.</p>

			<h3>10. Micro-etched Crystal</h3>
			<img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/sources/comp9.jpg" alt="">
			<p>In 2002, Rolex began micro-etching a tiny crown logo at the 6 o'clock position on the crystal that protects the dial. If you're looking at buying a Rolex made in 2002 onward, look for this marking for proof of authenticity. Since it's so small, it is difficult to see with the naked eye, and sometimes requires just the right lighting to properly view. The precision of this detail makes it difficult for counterfeit watches to replicate, and should always be something that you look for when buying a modern Rolex.</p>
